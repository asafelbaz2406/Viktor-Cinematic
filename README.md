🎨 Real-Time VFX & Shader Cinematic in Unity
This project showcases my technical artistry in **real-time rendering, VFX, and shader development** within Unity. 
The cinematic demonstrates my ability to merge **technical skills with artistic vision**, creating immersive and visually striking effects.

**✨ Featured Skills & Effects**
* **⚡ Lightning Strike** – Created using Photoshop and Blender for the texture and mesh, then implemented with Shader Graph and VFX Graph to achieve a dynamic and impactful effect.
* **🔥 Laser Attack** – Designed with Photoshop and Blender for asset creation, rendered using Shader Graph, VFX Graph, and Unity's Line Renderer to generate a seamless laser beam between two points.
* **👥 Summon Clones** – Spawns three clones (prefabs) that each cast the Laser skill, adding complexity to the sequence.

**🛠️ Technical Highlights**
* **🎭 Extensive use of shaders, VFX Graph, and HLSL shaders** for optimized real-time effects.
* **⚙️ Solved a compatibility issue with HLSL shaders and the SRP Batcher**, ensuring performance optimization.
* **🕹️ Implemented a combo system using the Command Pattern**, allowing skills and animations to chain fluidly.
* **📜 Used Scriptable Objects to manage skill delay and cast timers**, ensuring smooth transitions and precise timing.
* **🎥 Integrated Cinemachine** for dynamic camera movements and smooth transitions between shots.
* **💥 Added screen shake** to enhance impact and emphasize key moments in the cinematic.
* **🎬 Extensive use of DoTween sequences** for smooth and polished transitions between effects, animations, and camera movements.

This project reflects my expertise in **shader programming, real-time VFX, and technical problem-solving** within Unity. 🚀
